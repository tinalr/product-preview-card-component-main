## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS & SASS/SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- HTML ```<picture>``` tag. Used to make the product image responsive; the image file changes with the size of the screen.
- CSS ```letter-spacing``` property. Used to make the word "perfume" expanded.
